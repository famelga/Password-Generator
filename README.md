## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://famelga.github.io/Password-Generator/)

In order to generate a random password, employees are able to use this website.

I first used psuedo-code to plan which functions would be necessary. The first step was to create a prompt and confirms in a function that required employees to select their password  criteria. Since employees are required to create passwords with specific lengths and at least one character criteria, I included the prompt and confirms with a "while." The while will loop each question the previous one if the criteria requirements aren't satified.



## Portfolio Example

Below, I added the and if requirements.


```function gatherCrit() {
  // Create boolean variable
  var validPasswordLength = false;
  //Repeating loop till criteria is met
  while (validPasswordLength == false) {
    // Passing a string through the function prompt which returns a value that is saved to userlength
    var userlength = prompt("Enter password length. Must be between 8-128 characters in length.");
    // var userlength = prompt("Enter password length. Must be between 8-128 characters in length.");
    if (userlength >= minLength && userlength <= maxLenth) {
      validPasswordLength = true;
    } else {
      alert("Password must be between " + minLength + " and " +  maxLenth + " characters");
    }
  }
```

Here, the confirms are also in a while. In comparison to the prompt, the confirms need a logical or so that at least one criteria is selected.

```
  while (chCritMet == false) {
    // Passing string through the function confirm which returns a boolean value that is stored in its assigned var
    var lowLet = confirm("Include lowercase letters");
    // if the user wants lowercase letters, add "lower" to criteria array
    if (lowLet == true) {
      userCrit.concat(lChArr);
    }
    // Passing string through the function confirm which returns a boolean value that is stored in its assigned var
    var upLet = confirm("Include uppercase letters");
    // / if the user wants uppercase letters,
    if (upLet == true) {
      // add "upper" to criteria array
      userCrit.concat(upChArr);
    }
    // Passing string through the function confirm which returns a boolean value that is stored in its assigned var
    var num = confirm("Include numbers");
    // / if the user wants numbers,
    if (num == true) {
      // add "number" to criteria array
      userCrit.concat(intArr);
    }
    // Passing string through the function confirm which returns a boolean value that is stored in its assigned var
    var spCh = confirm("Include special character");
    // if the user wants special characters,
    if (spCh == true) {
      // add "special" to criteria array
      userCrit.concat(spChArr);
    }

    if (lowLet == true || upLet == true || num == true || spCh == true) {
      chCritMet = true;
    } else {
      alert("At least one character criteria must be selected.");
    }
  }
```
