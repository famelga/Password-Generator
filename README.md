## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://famelga.github.io/Password-Generator/)

In order to generate a random password, employees are able to use this website.

I first used psuedo-code to plan which functions would be necessary. The first step was to create a prompt and confirms in a function that required employees to select their password  criteria. Since employees are required to create passwords with specific lengths and at least one character criteria, I included the prompt and confirms with a "while." The while will loop each question the previous one if the criteria requirements aren't satified.



## Portfolio Example

Initially, I did not have any divs in my html code since I believed divs to be irrelevant due to lack of semantics and accessability.


```<section id="Work" class="sections">
                <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p class="c1">Landing Page</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/Landing-Page/" target="_blank"><img src="./LandingPage.png"
                            alt="Yellow website homepage with image of a nebula" class="pic1"></a>
                    <p class="c2">Code Refactor</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/code-refactor-site/" target="_blank"><img src="./Horiseon.png"
                            alt="Horiseon blue and white homepage" class="pic2"></a>
                    <p class="c2">CSS Cheatsheet</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/Mini-project-2/" target="_blank"><img src="./Cheatsheet.png"
                            alt="Gray website of css cheatsheet snippets" class="pic2"></a>
        </section>
```

Adding the below div tags with classes created sections for Flexboxes to be abpplied to in css. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)

```
html
<section id="Work" class="sections">
            <div class="Projh2">
                <h2>Work</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="work">
                <div class="work-content">
                    <p class="c1">Landing Page</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/Landing-Page/" target="_blank"><img src="./LandingPage.png"
                            alt="Yellow website homepage with image of a nebula" class="pic1"></a>
                </div>
                <div class="work-content">
                    <p class="c2">Code Refactor</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/code-refactor-site/" target="_blank"><img src="./Horiseon.png"
                            alt="Horiseon blue and white homepage" class="pic2"></a>
                    <p class="c2">CSS Cheatsheet</p>
                    <a href="https://famelga.github.io/Mini-project-2/" target="_blank"><img src="./Cheatsheet.png"
                            alt="Gray website of css cheatsheet snippets" class="pic2"></a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
```

This change led to the addition of "display: flex" and flexbox properties to the classes of the added divs.  

```css
.work {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
}

.work-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

## Learning Points 

Through the creation on my portfolio, I learned the importance of wireframes in relation to coding html. Labeling tags on wireframes helps with organization.

Prior to this project, I did not recognize the impact div tags have on the formatting of a webpage. I now understand that creating sections of code in html using divs, allows for the implementation of flexboxes in css.
